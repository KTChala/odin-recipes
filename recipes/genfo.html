    <img src="../images/genfo.webp" alt="a dish of genfo - ethiopian porridge">
    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Genfo is a thick, doughy porridge made from either wheat, barley, or maize flour and served, and enriched with berbere and niter kibbeh. One of the most unique features of Genfo is how it looks. When served, Genfo has a deep hole carved right in the middle where a dipping sauce made from a mixture of berbere and niter kibbeh is poured in. In Ethiopia, Genfo is customarily given to pregnant women and recovering new mothers as it is easily digestible, easy to make, as well as a nutrient-rich food source that helps them heal and regain strength quickly.</p>
      <p>Genfo can be shared or consumed individually, either by hand or using a spoon.</p>
